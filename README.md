## How to use

Add in Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'rails_admin_dropzone'
```

## IMPORTANT:

**For versions of rails below 5, use version [V1.0.1](https://github.com/luizpicolo/rails_admin_dropzone/releases/tag/V.1.0.1)**
**Tested with Rails 6**

```ruby
class Album < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :photos
end

class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :album
end
```

Add this method `create_associated_image` in your model, example `Album`, that will contain the upload images and change the associations and attributes

```ruby
class Album < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :photos

  # Method
  def create_associated_image(image)
    photos.create(image: image)
  end
end
```

Add in `config/initialisers/rails_admin.rb`

```ruby
RailsAdmin.config do |config|
  config.actions do
    dashboard
    index
    new

    dropzone do
      only YOUR_MODEL # Example Album
    end

    show
    edit
    delete
  end
end
```
and "VoalÃ¡"
